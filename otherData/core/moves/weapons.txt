Weapon Moves
How do you determine what Moves a Simple or Fine
Weapon grants? Weapons actually have a whole list of
Moves all to themselves, which are designed for you to
mix and match to best fit a given weapon's fluff. Simply
look through the list and pick Moves that make sense.
For example, Pierce! would go well on a spear, but Bash!
would not.
Weapon Moves are read in the same format as regular
Moves, though there is a bit of extra notation for them.
»
» "WR" is short for "Weapon Range" refers to the
Weapon's innate range. That is, Melee for Large and
Small Melee Weapons, 4 meters for Short Range
Weapons, and 12 meters for Long Range Weapons
with a restriction that they can't target anyone closer
than 4 meters.
»
» Limitations refer to the kinds of weapons that can
be granted the Move. For example, Backswing can
only be found on Large Melee Weapons.
»
» Weapon Suggestions are simply our suggestions for
what kinds of weapons the Move makes sense for, in
case it was confusing or you need a bit of guidance.
Some Features also allow you to use Moves you learn as
a Trainer "as a Weapon Attack". What this means is you
apply the Damage, AC, etc. modifiers from your Weapon
to the Move, and your Move gains the Weapon's Range
instead if it is 1-Target. Line and Ranged Blast Moves
retain their area-of-effect keyword but use the Weapon's
Range. Burst, Cone, and Close Blast Moves remain their
normal range.
