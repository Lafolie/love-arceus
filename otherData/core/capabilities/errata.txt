Capabilities
Forme Change: The user is capable of changing formes through a Move, Ability, or other effect. Keep a set of
Base Stats for each of the user's forme. All Formes must have the same total HP Stat value. If anything (such as an
Ability, Nature, Vitamin, etc.) alters the user's base stats, all forms are affected in the same way.
Leaf Crafter:  The user knows how to make useful accessories from mere common leaves, seeds, and other
mundane plant materials. Once per day as an extended action, the user may craft a Grass or Bug Type Booster or
Brace. These Held Items last the rest of the day and then degrade.
Gardener:  Up to three times per day as an Extended Action, the user may apply Mulch to a yielding plant.
