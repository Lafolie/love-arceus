Chapter 9:
Gear and Items
Trainer Essentials
A number of items are absolutely essential to a Trainer's
journey though the world of Pok�mon. Usually, a Trainer
given a Pok�mon for the first time by a sponsoring
Professor or the Pok�mon League organization will
be given a small package of gear to begin with. Other
times, Trainers scrape up the money themselves to buy
the basics before they begin their adventure.
Pok� Balls
Pok� Balls are specialized pieces of technology that
capture Pok�mon by transforming them into an energy
form and storing them in a shrinkable metal ball. They
come in many varieties, designed for different situations.
Some are better suited for capturing particular Types of
Pok�mon while others have special effects upon capture.
Throwing Pok� Balls is an AC6 Status Attack, with a
range equal to the Trainer's Throwing Range: 4 plus
their Athletics Rank. Resolve the attack like you would
any other. If it misses, the Pok� Ball lands harmlessly in
the terrain beyond the target. If it hits, and the Pok�mon
is able to be Captured, you then make a Capture Roll by
rolling 1d100 and subtracting the Trainer's Level. The
Type of Ball will also modify the Capture Roll. Pok�
Balls can recall Pok�mon into them from 8 meters away.
Pok� Balls cannot ever capture a Pok�mon that's been
reduced to 0 Hit Points or less. The energizing process
is too dangerous for seriously injured Pok�mon and
is thus halted by a failsafe built into all Pok� Balls and
Pok� Ball parts sold on the market for self-assembly.
And of course, Pok� Balls fail to activate against owned
Pok�mon already registered to a Trainer and Ball!
Pok�dex
This hand-held computer with an advanced camera and
image recognition software is given out to new trainers
at the start of their journey. As a Standard Action, a
Trainer can use their Pok�dex to identify a Pok�mon
within 10 meters using the Pok�dex's scanner. Doing
so reveals the average height and weight of the species,
height and weight of the individual being targeted,
Moves that the Species learns through Level Up, and
some brief facts about the species' typical behavior.
These machines may also function as mobile phones,
radios, and hand-held internet browsers, much like
typical smartphones. Other apps may be installed to
grant them further uses. They cost $12,000 or more, but
in most circumstances they should be made available
for free to starting characters.

Pok� Ball Chart
Basic Balls are sold for $250, Great Balls for $400 and Ultra Balls for $800. All Special balls are usually sold for
$800 as well, though they may not always be available in every shop.
Why are Pok� Balls so cheap for pieces of advanced technology, especially compared to other items available in the
Pok�mon Tabletop United handbook? Well, it's largely because the game is so dependent on their easy accessibility.
If you need an in-setting reason, Pok� Ball production is likely subsidized by the government due to their ubiquity.

GM Tip: A good way to give towns in your campaign a little flavor is to make different kinds of Special Pok� Balls
be available in each. This can be based on what sort of Apricorns grow nearby, or simply due to the location of the
town; a town next to a large cave system may produce Dusk Balls, while a town by the beach may produce Lure or
Dive Balls.
You may even want to invent your own custom Pok� Balls for your campaign. Think about what kinds of
customizations would be useful to the locals or visitors. A snowy mountain town may have invented a variation of
the Net Ball that catches Rock and Ice Type Pok�mon more easily, for example.
Gear and Items

Bait: Bait is a tasty, strong-smelling morsel of food
designed to attract Pok�mon. It may be used in two
ways; to lure Pok�mon, or to distract Pok�mon. Bait can
be bought for $250.
To lure Pok�mon, set the bait on a route. Every 15
minutes thereafter, roll 1d20 until you roll 15 or higher.
If you roll 3 times without success, the bait loses its
potency and fails. If you succeed however, a random
Pok�mon, based on your GM's discretion will appear.
The Pok�mon attracted with bait should usually be of a
Level comparable to the party's Pok�mon. Bait is often
used for Fishing in this way.
To distract Pok�mon, throw it at a Wild Pok�mon as a
Standard Action. The target must then make a Focus
Roll with a DC of 12. If they fail, the Pok�mon gives up
its next Standard Action to eat the food.
Collection Jar: A simple sealable glass jar. Useful when
collecting Items from Pok�mon, such as Honey from
Pok�mon with the Honey Gather Ability, or MooMoo
Milk from Pok�mon with the Milk Collection Ability.
Available almost everywhere, and cost $100.
First Aid Kit: Required to use the First Aid Expertise
Feature. By Draining 1 AP, any Trainer can make a
Medicine Education Check on a target as an Extended
Action. The target gains Hit Points equal to the result,
and is cured of Burn, Poison, and Paralysis. Costs $500.
Fishing Lure: Instead of Bait, some trainers may opt
to use a Fishing Lure when attempting to Fish. Fishing
Lures work just like Bait, but can be used multiple times.
If the line snaps or the fish gets away, they may take your
lure with them, however. Fishing Lures cost $1500.
Saddle: Saddles help Trainers ride Pok�mon. They are
created with a specific Pok�mon species in mind, and
only Pok�mon with that body type can wear the saddle.
A common Saddle type fits Ponyta, Rapidash, Blitzle,
and Zebstrika, for example. Saddles grant a +3 bonus to
all Skill Checks made to mount Pok�mon, or to remain
on the Saddle when hit by an attack. Costs $2000.
Rope: Rope has many different uses, and is thus popular
gear for explorers, campers, and hikers. Rope can only
be damaged by Fire-Type attacks, or attacks made with
sharp objects � knives, swords, sharp teeth, and Moves
like Scratch, Slash, Leaf Blade, Razor Leaf, etc. The
Move Cut ignores all Damage Reduction against Rope.
Rope can be bought in any length of 25 Feet up to 300.
The listed prices below reflect 25 feet of rope; simply
multiply the price appropriately for more.
�
� Basic Rope: Basic Fiber Rope. Has a tensile strength
of 35 kg or 77 lbs. It has 5 Hit Points. Costs $100
�
� Utility Rope: Braided Utility Rope. Has a tensile
strength of 80 kg or 176 lbs. It has 20 Hit Points and
10 Damage Reduction. Costs $200
�
� Sturdy Rope: Sturdy Rope with a tensile strength
of 225 kg or roughly 500lbs. 30 Hit Points and 20
Damage Reduction. Costs $400
Sleeping Bag: A standard sleeping bag. Costs $1000 for
a single, or $1800 for a double.
Tents: Standard outdoor tents. Provide protection from
the elements of nature. Costs $400 per meter cubed.
(A small one person tent would be about 1m x 1.5m x
1.5m, or 2.25 cubic meters� meaning 900 in price. )
Lighter: For creating flames in a hurry. A regular
convenience store lighter costs $150; a waterproof
lighter costs $1000.
Flashlight: For, you know, seeing. In the dark. Yes.
Costs $200 for a regular Flashlight; + $400 to make it
Waterproof.
Water Filter: Can ensure that river or pond water is
clean to drink after being filtered. Costs $500.

Repels: Repels can be sprayed on one's self in order to
ward off wilds with a subtle smell that greatly annoys
Pok�mon. It's best to not make your own Pok�mon
endure the smell while using Repels yourself. Most wild
Pok�mon won't bother you when you spray Repel on
yourself, and will make themselves scarce before you
even approach.
Spraying a wild Pok�mon directly with Repel will cause
that Pok�mon, if the Repel can affect Pok�mon of that
level, to immediately shift away from the user as far as
the Pok�mon is able as an Interrupt, forfeiting their next
Shift Action. Spraying a Pok�mon with a Repel is an
AC6 Status Attack.

Medicines
Potions and other Basic Restorative Items are
a useful way for Trainers to keep their Pok�mon
in fighting shape without needing to return
to a Pok�mon center every single time they
run into an angry wild Pok�mon. Potions are
sold in small, one time use spray bottles that
when sprayed on a Pok�mon, sterilize and heal
wounds.
Potions and other Basic Restoratives can be
used on Pok�mon and Humans alike to repair
damaged tissue and seal wounds. If the entire
bottle of Potion isn't used, it cannot take effect
on the Pok�mon.
Be careful with "Repulsive" medicines! They
decrease a Pok�mon's loyalty with repeated use.
Most of these items are available for sale at
Pok�Marts. They are essential equipment that
adventuring Trainers need to have access to
while they are out on the road, far from any
Pok�mon Centers.
X-Items on the other hand are a bit rarer, often
sold only in specialty shops or large shopping
centers. Unlike Basic Restorative items, they
only function on Pok�mon � not on Trainers �
and are used for augmenting Combat Stages in
battle rather than healing wounds. Their effect
lasts until the end of an encounter.
Using Items
Applying Restorative Items, or X Items is a
Standard Action, which causes the target to
forfeit their next Standard Action and Shift
Action, unless the user has the "Medic Training"
Edge. The target of these items may refuse to
stay still and be healed; in that case, the item is
not used, and the target does not forfeit their
actions.
If you use a Restorative Item on yourself it is a
Full-Round action, but you do not forfeit any
further actions.
Some Items may operate under different rules,
if stated in their description.

Bandages and Poultices
Bandages are important medical supplies for
traveling Trainers that aren't quite the same as
other Restorative Items.
Bandages are applied as Extended Actions
on Pok�mon or Trainers. Bandages last for 6
hours; while applied, they double the Natural Healing
Rate of Pok�mon or Trainers, meaning a Pok�mon or
Trainer will heal 1/8th of their Hit Points per half hour.
Bandages also immediately heal one Injury if they
remain in place for their full duration.
If a Pok�mon is damaged or loses Hit Points in any way,
the Bandages immediately stop working.
Bandages can be found in even minor convenience
stores for $300. Poultices have the same effect as
Bandages, but are itchy and irritating to the skin � they
may lower the loyalty of Pok�mon if used too often,
much like Repulsive medicine.
Note: Multiple Bandages may be used throughout the
day to heal injuries, but only 3 Injuries can be removed
per day through any combination of Items, Features, or
Natural Healing.
Bandages are incredibly helpful for extended treks in
the wilderness where you might accrue multiple injuries
over days without seeing a Pok�mon Center.
Item Effect Cost
Bandages See attached Section $300
Poultices See attached Section - Repulsive $225

Food Items
Food Items are just
what they sound like.
By far the largest
category of Food Items
is Berries, but many
other kinds of food
exist too. Candy Bars
and Refreshments are
commonly sold in
Pok�Marts. Leftovers
or Black Sludge must
be found in more
specialized shops.
Snacks
Item Effects Cost
Candy Bar Snack. Grants a Digestion Buff that heals 5 Hit Points. $75
Honey
Snack. Grants a Digestion Buff that heals 5 Hit Points. May be
used as Bait
$100
Leftovers
Snack. When their Digestion Buff is traded in, the user recovers
1/16th of their max Hit Points at the beginning of each turn for
the rest of the encounter.
$350
Black
Sludge
Poison-Type Pok�mon may consume the Black Sludge as a
Snack Item; when the Digestion Buff is traded in, they recover
1/8th of their Max Hit Points at the beginning of each turn for
the rest of the encounter.
$500
Snacks may be consumed at any time by a Pok�mon or
Trainer as an Extended Action to grant a Digestion Buff.
A Pok�mon or Trainer may only have one Digestion Buff
stored at a time unless they have the Gluttony Ability,
and they made trade in this Buff during battle to
use the effect of the Snack. Berries are considered
snacks.
Some Snacks require a certain condition to be
met before a Digestion Buff can be traded in. For
example, Digestion Buffs from Berries cannot be
traded in unless the user is at 50% Hit Points or
lower or unless the user is suffering from a Status
Affliction the Berry's Digestion Buff can cure. Some
Berries specify alternate conditions instead, such as
being dealt a certain kind of damage or being hit by a
Type of attack.
Candy Bars and Leftovers are the two other most common
forms of snacks. Chefs however, are capable of creating
diverse varieties of Snacks by using ingredients.
Gear and Items
279
Refreshment Items
Pok�mon and Trainers alike love to relax and have some food. Refreshments are Items that grant their effects when
they are consumed as an Extended Action outside of combat.
While they can't heal in a pinch like Potions do,
they are a cheaper alternative for healing while
outside of battle. A Pok�mon or Trainer can
only consume one refreshment per half hour,
unless they have the Gluttony Ability.
Miscellaneous Food
Food under this category is basically only food fluff-wise; they are consumable items that require an Extended
Action to consume, have varying effects, and do not affect how many Snacks or Refreshments you can eat or drink.
Baby Food: A nutritious food that causes young Pok�mon to grow quickly. When consumed, increases Experience
Gain of Pok�mon at level 15 or lower by 20% for the rest of the day.
Item Effects Cost
Enriched Water Heals 20 Hit Points. $75
Shuckle's Berry Juice Heals 30 Hit Points. ---
Super Soda Pop Heals 30 Hit Points. $125
Sparkling Lemonade Heals 50 Hit Points. $250
MooMoo Milk Heals 80 Hit Points. $500

Apricorns, Berries, and Herbs
Berries and Herbs are a particular kind of snack food item which grow naturally throughout the world. Some
berries, like Oran Berries, are very common, while others are very rare. Herbs in general tend to be rare in the wild.
Common Berries are easily found in Pok�mon supply stores, grocery stores, and similar. Rare berries and herbs
may only be found at specialty shops.
Apricorns, Berries, and Herbs may be grown by a Trainer with the appropriate Features or Edges, assuming they
have access to enough space to plant their Plants.
Once planted, it takes two days for a Plant to Mature. After becoming Mature, a plant's caretaker should roll the
plant's Yield Roll every day. They gain a number of Berries (or Herbs, Apricorns, etc.) equal to the result of the
Yield Roll; if the result is zero or a negative number, no Berries are received that day.
Yield Rolls may be modified by Soil Quality however. The Yield Rolls above assume a +0 Soil Quality. Portable
Growers, or exceptionally fertile natural spots have a Soil Quality of +1 instead, which means all Plants growing
there increase Yield Rolls by +1. And many places have considerably WORSE soil quality (good luck growing
berries in sand; hint it's not going to work).
Mulch may be used to temporarily increase soil Quality; it may be applied to a Plant to increase the Soil Quality
of a plant by +1 for the following day. This cannot make a Soil Quality go above +2. Mulch costs $200 per unit.

Apricorns are fruit that can be turned into Apricorn
Pok� Balls. Finding a smith to make them isn't always
easy. It's usually simpler to buy the Pok� Balls in stores.
Herbs
Herbs have varied effects, ranging from acting as
repulsive restorative items to giving Pok�mon unique
advantages in the middle of battle. Energy Roots and
Revival Herbs are used as restorative items in battle.
Mental, Power, and White Herbs are Snack Items.
Mushrooms are Held Items and consumed as a Shift

Crafting Kits
These items are either required to use certain crafting
Edges and Features or greatly aid in their use by finding
raw material items.
Chemistry Set: Used to create Repels, Potions, and
other objects. Costs $1000.
Cooking Set: Used by Chefs to create Snacks and
Refreshments. Costs $1000.
Dowsing Rod: Dowsing Rods have been attuned to
the energy resonance given off by Shards. They may be
used while in any route, cave, or outside area and can be
bought for $2000. They may be activated by spending
10 minutes searching an area, and may be activated a
number of times per day equal to half of the trainer's
Occult Education Rank.
After the 10 minutes, roll 1d6 per Occult Education
Rank. If the area being searched is a beach, cave, desert,
or any other sandy or rocky area, roll +1d6. If you have
Skill Stunt (Dowsing), you roll an additional 1d6.
For each die that results in 4 or higher, you find 1 Shard
of a random color: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, or
Violet. You may reroll any die that result in 6, gaining
that shard and potentially more.
Poffin Mixer: A Poffin Mixer can be used by any Trainer
to create Poffins. You simply insert cooking ingredients
worth $500, and at least one of the listed berries. You
create two Poffins that raises the Contest Stat most
represented by the berries used by +1 Contest Die. Some
Berries can raise multiple Contest Stats; you choose
which to raise when using these Berries to make Poffins.
Cheri, Figy, Razz, Spelon and Belue Berries raise Cool;
Chesto, Wiki, Bluk, Spelon and Pamtre Berries raise
Beauty; Pecha, Mago, Nanab, Pamtre, and Watmel
Berries raise Cute; Rawst, Aguav, Wepear, Watmel,
and Durin Berries raise Smart; Aspear, Iapapa, Pinap,
Durin, and Belue Berries raise Tough. Poffins can be
purchased for $500 in bakeries and Contest halls, and
Poffin Mixers cost $500 as well.
Pok� Ball Tool Box: These tool boxes let those with the
know-how craft and repair Pok� Balls. They cost $500
and can be found in most Pok� Marts.
Portable Grower / Berry Planter: Portable Growers can
be used to grow berries and herbs. Portable Growers
protect the plants within them from external weather,
and never need to be fertilized. Each Grower holds one
plant. Portable Growers cost $2000.
Shards: Shards are bits of colored energized crystal
and are used for various crafting purposes. Each color
is associated with three Types. Red is Fire, Fairy, and
Psychic; Orange is Normal, Fighting, and Dragon;
Yellow is Electric, Rock and Steel; Green is Bug, Grass,
and Ground; Blue is Water, Ice, and Flying; Violet is
Poison, Dark, and Ghost.

Scrap and Crafting Items
Scrap is a mechanic that allows Trainers with Crafting
Edges and Features to make better use of them without
causing other items to be too easily acccessible due to
the amount of money they have on hand. Put simply
Scrap is money that can only be used to pay for a certain
category of Crafting Edge or Feature.
For example, a Chef taking home leftover ingredients
from a restaurant at the end of a day might have Scrap
to pay for $500 of Chef Features. A gadgeteer rooting
through a junkyard might be able to salvage parts equal
to $1000 worth of Pok� Ball crafting. This lets a GM to
regularly reward players who rely on Crafting with the
resources they need to function without tempting play-
ers with extra crash to buy TMs or other luxury items.
Trainers can also disassemble any item they are capa-
ble of crafting to gain Scrap equal to half the cost they
would pay to create the item. For example, a Fashionista
can cut up Fancy Clothes for cloth Scraps worth $1250
for using their other Features.
Scrap is always tied to a particular item category. Here
are some suggestions for those categories.
�
� Food: Snack Items, Refreshment Items, Bait Items,
Baby Food
�
� Medicines: All Basic Restoratives, X-Items, Dire
Hit, Guard Spec, Vitamins
�
� Repellents: All Repel Items, all Pester Balls
�
� Pok� Balls: All Pok� Balls
�
� Fashion Items: Items the Fashionista creates

Equipment
Trainers can don equipment to help protect them on their journeys or grant them special effects. They may only
equip one piece of Equipment per Equipment slot though; the slots are Head, Main Hand, Off-Hand, Body, Feet,
and Accessory.
"Held Items" and "Equipment" share many similarities. "Equipment" is usable only by Trainers. Most Held Items
are usable by Trainers as well; most Held Items are accessory-slot items when used by Trainers, but some may differ
according to their description. See the next section for details on Held Items.
Equipping an Item or switching one for another takes a Standard Action. Handing another Trainer an item or
equipment piece is similarly a Standard Action, but this does not equip the item for them, only grants them
the ability to equip it themselves. Equipping a Held Item onto a Pok�mon is a Standard Action that causes the
Pok�mon to forfeit their next turn.
Gear and Items
287
Weapons
Weapons are perhaps the most common type of
Equipment. Weapons are Main Hand Equipment pieces
that modify Struggle Attacks. Weapons may also allow
Trainers to use Moves as long as they have a high enough
Combat Skill Rank. Weapons come in three quality
categories, Crude, Simple, and Fine. Crude Weapons
do not grant Moves but instead only modify Struggle
Attacks. Simple Weapons grant a single Move that can
be used if the wielder has Adept Combat or higher, and
Fine Weapons grant two Moves, one at Adept Combat
or higher and another at Master Combat or higher.
Roughly speaking, Crude Weapons are usually more
everyday items that have been adapted to use as
weapons, Simple Weapons are "proper" weapons but
unexceptional, and Fine Weapons are weapons of a
quality you may expect on law enforcement or anyone
else wielding a weapon in a professional capacity.
There are four kinds of Weapons; Large Melee Weapons,
Small Melee Weapons, Short-Range Weapons, and
Long-Range Weapons. If a Weapon is One-Handed, it
simply takes up the Main Hand slot � if it's two handed,
it takes up the Off-Hand Slot as well. When wielding a
One-Handed Weapon in the Off-Hand slot, Trainers do
not gain a Master Move from that Weapon and take a -2
penalty to Accuracy Rolls for all Weapon Attacks made
with that Weapon.
Large Melee Weapons raise the AC of the Attack by +1,
and raise the Damage Base by +2. Large Melee Weapons
are two-handed.
Small Melee Weapons raise the Damage Base by +1.
These weapons are obviously one-handed!
Foot Weapons: Hey, if someone wants to make Steel-
Toed Boots or similar as Weapons and equip them in
the Foot Slot ... let them go for it. These are Small Melee
Weapons, but also raise the AC of the attack by +1.
Short Range Weapons have a Range of 4 meters. Short-
Range weapons are one-handed.
Long Range Weapons raise the AC of the Attack by
+1, have a range of 12 meters, and raise the Damage
Base by +1. Long Range Weapons can't target Pok�mon
or Trainers that are closer than 4 meters from the user.
Long Range Weapons are two-handed.
Improvised Weapons: If your Trainers make attacks
with unconventional objects, let them benefit from
having a weapon, but impose a penalty based on the
item. Perhaps the item can only attack once and then
breaks. Perhaps an item is badly balanced, like a thrown
stone, and takes a -1 penalty to AC. Or perhaps it's just
not very good at dishing out pain; lower the Damage
Base by -1 or more. Hitting with a Pillow might be a
DB1 attack no matter how strong you are, for example.
Weapons may also have additional characteristics based
on what they are, such as a spear granting the Reach
Capability for attacks made with the weapon or sword
breakers giving a bonus to Disarm Maneuvers.
All modifications that a Weapon makes to Struggle
Attacks also apply to the Moves they grant and to Moves
granted by Features with the [Weapon] tag. However,
these Moves can never benefit from STAB. For example,
a Large Melee Weapon with an AC 2 DB 4 Move would
cause the wielder to use it as if it had AC 3 and DB 6.
A Long or Short Range weapon granting a Move would
use the Move as if it had a range equal to the Weapon's.
GM Tips: The cost of weapons should be very dependent
on the region. However, Crude Weapons are universally
cheap and can be bought for $500 or less, assuming one
doesn't simply go into the kitchen and grab a knife there
or take a crowbar from the tool box.
Simple Weapons and Fine Weapons are unmistakably
designed to be used as weapons and nothing more,
so their prices are more subject to the legality and
treatment of weapons in your setting. If weapons are
commonplace and legal, Simple Weapons may be
as cheap as $2000 and Fine Weapons $4000. If all
weapons are very illegal, Simple Weapons may cost
$5000 and Fine Weapons $10,000 or more. On average,
they should cost about $3000 for Simple Weapons and
$6000 for Fine Weapons.
Another thing to think about is what sort of weapons
are allowed. Maybe the police is going to show up very
quickly at the sight of teenagers traveling with swords,
bows, and spears � definitely Simple or Fine Weapons.
But what about baseball bats, slingshots, and hockey
sticks as Crude Weapons? Establishing the framework of
what constitutes a common `weapon' in your campaign
is important, and can help set the tone of the campaign.

Weapon Moves
How do you determine what Moves a Simple or Fine
Weapon grants? Weapons actually have a whole list of
Moves all to themselves, which are designed for you to
mix and match to best fit a given weapon's fluff. Simply
look through the list and pick Moves that make sense.
For example, Pierce! would go well on a spear, but Bash!
would not.
Weapon Moves are read in the same format as regular
Moves, though there is a bit of extra notation for them.
�
� "WR" is short for "Weapon Range" refers to the
Weapon's innate range. That is, Melee for Large and
Small Melee Weapons, 4 meters for Short Range
Weapons, and 12 meters for Long Range Weapons
with a restriction that they can't target anyone closer
than 4 meters.
�
� Limitations refer to the kinds of weapons that can
be granted the Move. For example, Backswing can
only be found on Large Melee Weapons.
�
� Weapon Suggestions are simply our suggestions for
what kinds of weapons the Move makes sense for, in
case it was confusing or you need a bit of guidance.
Some Features also allow you to use Moves you learn as
a Trainer "as a Weapon Attack". What this means is you
apply the Damage, AC, etc. modifiers from your Weapon
to the Move, and your Move gains the Weapon's Range
instead if it is 1-Target. Line and Ranged Blast Moves
retain their area-of-effect keyword but use the Weapon's
Range. Burst, Cone, and Close Blast Moves remain their
normal range.

Hand Equipment
Equipment Effect
Fishing Rod
Fishing Rods are used to Fish. They are two-handed items. They come in three varieties; Old
Rods, Good Rods, and Super Rods. Old Rods cost $1000, Good Rods cost $5,000, and Super
Rods cost $15,000.
Glue
Cannon
Glue Cannons are exactly what you expect; This two-handed Equipment piece is a hand-held
cannon that launches globs of glue. Attacking with a Glue Cannon expends a charge, which must
be purchased. The attack is an AC8 Status Attack. If it hits, the target is Slowed. On a critical hit,
the target is instead Stuck and Trapped. The Glue Cannon and three charge packets cost $3000,
and additional charge packets costs $100.
Hand Net
A long net, usually on the end of a long stick, these pieces of two-handed Equipment are usually
used for bug catching or fishing. As an AC6 Status Attack, you may attempt to net a Small
Pok�mon using this item. If you hit, you manage to scoop up the Pok�mon, trapping them. You
may move with the Pok�mon, dragging them with you. Pok�mon may still attack from the Hand
Net using long-range attacks, or try to attack the net itself, potentially breaking it and freeing
themselves. Capture Rolls against Pok�mon in a net receive a -20 bonus.
Hand Nets with 50 Hit Points cost $100; 100 Hit Points cost $600; and 200 Hit Points cost
$1500. Nets aren't broken until all of their Hit Points are depleted.
Weighted
Nets
Weighted Nets are foldable nets used for trapping Pok�mon. These two-handed nets, when
Equipped, can be thrown at a target as a Standard Action, as a Status Attack with an AC of 8.
While a Pok�mon is netted, you may pull on the rope attached to the Net to pull the Pok�mon 1
Meter towards you as a Standard Action.
Pok�mon hit by a weighted net become Slowed as long as the net remains and cannot use Sky or
Levitate Speeds except to safely lower themselves back to the ground. A Pok�mon may attack the
Net to attempt to break free. Capture Rolls against Pok�mon in a net receive a -20 bonus.
Weighted Nets with 50 Hit Points cost $500; 80 Hit Points cost $850; and 150 Hit Points cost
$1200.
Capture
Styler
A Capture Styler is a Main-Hand specialized piece of equipment used by some certified Pok�mon
Rangers in a region. It emits a string of energy that is used in a similar fashion to a lasso but is too
weak to physically restrain a target. Instead, the energy has a calming effect on Pok�mon.
Trainers using a Capture Styler may use Survival in place of Charm when raising the Disposition
of Pok�mon. Acquiring a Capture Styler is easy for those who become certified Pok�mon Rangers;
most qualified Rangers receive one as part of the job. They are not for sale to the general public
and may cost upwards of $7500 on the black market due to their iconic nature � it's easy to
assume that someone who has a Capture Styler is a Ranger.
Light Shield
A Shield is an Off-Hand defensive item held in one hand or braced to an arm. Light Shields
grant +2 Evasion. They may be readied as a Standard Action to instead grant +4 Evasion and 10
Damage Reduction until the end of your next turn, but also cause you to become Slowed for that
duration. If used Two-Handed, light shields can also function as a Small Melee Weapon. Light
Shields cost around $3000.
Heavy Shield
A Shield is an Off-Hand defensive item held in one hand or braced to an arm. Heavy Shields
grnat +2 Evasion and may be readied as a Standard Action to grant +6 Evasion and 15 Damage
Reduction until the end of your next turn, but also cause you to become Slowed for that duration.
If used Two-Handed, shields can also function as a Small Melee Weapon. Heavy Shields cost
around $4500.

Wonder
Launcher
This strange and complicated two-handed machine can only be used by those that have an
Expert-Level Medicine or Technology Education Skill. The wielder can spend 1 AP to activate
it, and apply an X-Item at a Pok�mon within 8 meters. X-Items applied through the Wonder
Launcher do not cause the target to forfeit any actions. Items combined by a Researcher may be
used in the Wonder Launcher, and do not cause the target to forfeit any actions even if they are
also a Restorative. Wonder Launchers cost $10,000 or more.
Accessory Items
Equipment Effect
Focus
A Focus grants +5 Bonus to a Stat, chosen when crafted. This Bonus is applied AFTER Combat
Stages. Focuses are often Accessory-Slot Items, but may be crafted as Head-Slot, Hand or Off-
Hand Slot Items as well; a Trainer may only benefit from one Focus at a time, regardless of
the Equipment Slot. Focuses are not usually found in stores, but may sometimes be found for
$6000 at your GM's discretion.
Snag Machine
Snag Machines are extremely illegal machines that allow trainers to steal another Trainer's
Pok�mon. They come in both large, immovable varieties and smaller portable varieties. The
Portable Variety is an Accessory-Slot Item. Inserting a Pok� Ball into a Large Snag Machine
turns it into a Snag Ball permanently, but Large Snag Machines may only turn 5 Pok� Balls
into Snag Balls per day. Inserting a Pok� Ball into a Portable Snag Machine, which is a Swift
Action, turns it into a Snag Ball after one round, but only for that round. Snag Balls have
the same properties as the Pok� Ball type they were before being inserted into the machine,
but receive a -2 penalty on all Pok� Ball attack rolls, and are capable of capturing owned
Pok�mon. Snag Machines cannot be bought in stores, but may sell on the black market for
prices of $30,000 or more.
Mega Ring
Mega Rings are extraordinarily rare accessories that allow a Trainer's Pok�mon to Mega Evolve
when used in conjunction with a Mega Stone. They cannot be bought in stores anywhere and
must usually be earned through a trial of sorts, governed by a Gym Leader or other influential
Pok�mon Trainer. They can take the form of a bracelet, a necklace, or an actual ring.
GM TIP: Creating Your Own Items
You're going to want to create your own equipment; don't be afraid to do so! One way to provide trainers with
useful and flavorful equipment is to provide gear that gives small bonuses to Skills; ranging from +1 to +4 at the
maximum. Some Gear may provide these bonuses only in specific circumstances; that kind of gear can afford to
give higher bonuses, or simply be cheaper.
Feel free to tailor these items to your PCs or NPCs, and to your setting. A "Pok�mon League Cap" could be a great
item to include to grant +2 to Command Checks in a Standard Pok�mon setting; a Pok�mon War Setting might be
better off with a "Officer's Stripes" or similar.
When creating Items, assign them to an equipment slot that makes sense; that +2 Intimidate Eyepatch obviously
goes on the Head Slot, but that +2 Intimidate Studded Leather Jacket could be a Body or Accessory Slot Item.
Don't be afraid to experiment with more exotic effects! For example, some equipment items may allow a Trainer
to use a Move, such as a fancy hat that lets a Trainer use the Move Swagger once a Scene. These items should allow
Trainers to use Moves at a lower rate than their natural frequency. Be careful that you don't give out effects that are
too powerful or that step on the toes of some PC classes! Finally, you can afford to be a little flexible with which
items go in which equipment slots. While it'd make no sense to wear a Gas Mask and Sunglasses simultaneously, if
someone wears a Helmet in their Head Slot, you may let them wear Sunglasses as an Accessory Slot Item.

Pok�mon Items
Held Items
During battle, a Pok�mon may be given a single "Held Item". Berries, Herbs, and Snack Foods are common
consumable held items that are destroyed when used, but there are many other items crafted especially for battle.
On the following page is a chart listing various Held Items that grant a specific boon while held as a Static ability.
They do not need to be activated; simply holding them is enough. Held Items may be dropped by Pok�mon
on their turn as a Free Action. Many held items can be used by Trainers as well. When this is the case, they're
described with the associated equipment slot used by a Trainer. Not all Held Items can be purchased. Some are rare
and must be found; these Held Items are marked with a -- in place of a price.
Fluffing Held Items: Fluffing Held Items may in some cases be a little awkward. The most convenient explanation
is to simply view them as amulets to be worn on a cord around the Pok�mon's neck or on a collar. Or perhaps a
nice hat; everyone loves hats. Some Items like Stat Boosters may be fluffed as armor that covers the Pok�mon, or
even weapons that can be attached to the Pok�mon's natural weapons.

Pok�mon Toolkits
The following Items help with various tasks related to
the raising of Pok�mon.
Egg Warmer: Egg Warmers are insulated cases that
carry up to four Pok�mon Eggs and protect them from
harm. They also cause Pok�mon to hatch twice as fast;
each day spent in an Egg Warmer counts as 2 days for
the purposes of Hatch Rate. Egg Warmers cost $2500.
Groomer's Kit: Used by Trainers with the Groomer
Edge to clean their Pok�mon. Costs $500.
Reanimation Machine: Can be used to revive Fossils.
Reanimation Machines also come in a smaller but
more expensive Portable variety. Prices are up to GM
discretion, often upwards of $10,000. See the Pok�mon
Fossils section for more details (page 216).
Evolutionary Items
Some Pok�mon evolve upon contact with radioactive Elemental Stones, while rarer evolutions take place only
once a Pok�mon becomes bonded to a keepsake of sorts. Here are the relevant Elemental Stones and a list of
Evolutionary Keepsake. All of these items can be bought for $3000 in major stores.

Vitamins
Vitamins are special nutritional drinks which can permanently improve aspects of your Pok�mon. However, you
may only get use out of up to five Vitamins per Pok�mon. After you have used five Vitamins on a Pok�mon, any
Vitamins fed to a Pok�mon afterwards will have no effect.
Vitamin Effect Cost
HP Up Raise the user's HP Base Stat 1. $4900
Protein Raise the user's Attack Base Stat 1. $4900
Iron Raise the user's Defense Base Stat 1. $4900
Calcium Raise the user's Special Attack Base Stat 1. $4900
Zinc Raise the user's Special Defense Base Stat 1. $4900
Carbos Raise the user's Speed Base Stat 1. $4900
Heart Booster The Pok�mon gains 2 Tutor Points. Use only one per Pok�mon. $9800
PP Up Raise one of the user's Move's Frequency one level. Use only one per Pok�mon. $9800
Note: PP Ups work differently than they have in previous versions.
At-Will Moves cannot have their Frequency increased further. EOT Moves become At-Will. Daily and Scene
Moves gain an additional use in their Frequency's unit of time. For example, a Daily Move becomes Daily x2, and
a Scene x2 Move becomes Scene x3.

The following aren't Vitamins, strictly speaking, but they are related to Vitamins in some way.
Heart Scale: This tiny rainbow scale from a Luvdisc is valued by Apothecary Researchers, because it can be used to
create the Heart Booster vitamin. Luvdiscs will produce them occasionally; they can be found along sandy beach-
es, and ancient ones can be found in desert, caves, or underground. Heart Scales cannot normally be bought, but
Heart Boosters are detailed in the vitamins section.
Rare Candy: These very rare treats are created from Shuckles that have held a Berry for a long time. When ingested
by a Pok�mon, the eater gains enough experience to reach its next Level. Pok�mon may benefit from up to five Rare
Candies in their lifetime. Rare Candies can cost $9800 or more.
Stat Suppressants: These medicines have an identical effect to the Suppressant Berries � they lower one of the
user's Base Stats by 1 point and only function if the Trainer of the Pok�mon wants them to. These cost $500.

TMs and HMs
TMs and HMs, or Technical Machines and Hidden Machines, are objects used to teach Pok�mon Moves.
TMs are dispensable, one-time use items. HMs on the other hand can be used once per day. TMs and HMs take
about an hour to take effect; after this time is up, the Pok�mon learns the move associated with the TM or HM.
Not every Pok�mon can learn every TM though; check the Pok�mon's TM List to see if they are capable of learning
that TM. Furthermore, be aware that only 3 of a Pok�mon's Moves can come from TMs or Tutor Moves. See the
"Moves" section under Pok�mon for more details (page 200). TM Moves cost a Pok�mon 1 Tutor Point to learn,
though if this Move is forgotten and replaced by another TM Move (keeping the total number of TM Moves the
same or lower than previously), the new Move does not cost an extra Tutor Point.
GM TIP: As to what TMs and HMs actually ARE, well, that's something every GM needs to decide and establish
at the beginning of their campaign.
The easiest solution is to make them small compact discs, activated by the TM Case itself. The Pok�mon's Pok�
Ball is then inserted into the TM Case, which then digitally transfers the Move information to the Pok�mon. If
this method is used, know that using TMs on Pok�mon without Pok� Balls will be impossible. Furthermore, the
Pok�mon being taught the Move is unavailable for the hour it takes to fully learn the Move.
Another solution is to make them Syringes that need to be injected into a Pok�mon. If this is the case, consider
requiring trainers to make a Medicine Education Check with a DC of 8 or so to apply Syringes; you don't want to
inject the TM liquid in the wrong place, after all! You should decide what failure means; is the TM simply wasted?
Or is the Pok�mon injured instead? Both? Before choosing this option, consider the barrier to entry it poses to
trainers both mechanically and psychologically; most trainers don't want to drive needles into their own Pok�mon,
after all.
You can use one, both, or neither of the methods above. Feel free to come up with your own solutions about the
nature of TMs. If your campaign takes place in an alternate setting, consider adjusting TMs accordingly. In one
"Wild West" Themed setting, TMs were represented as hallucinogenic substances designed to take Pok�mon on a
"spirit quest" to teach them the new Move.

Combat Items
The following are items that are largely consumables
to be used in combat. That isn't to say that all of them
are strictly combat items, but their primary use will be
during fights.
Caltrops & Toxic Caltrops: These items let the user
use the Move Spikes and Toxic Spikes, respectively, as a
Standard Action. The item is then consumed. Caltrops
are not usually sold in stores, but may be found from
specialty shops for $500.
Dream Mist: Dream Mist may be used as an AC 6
Melee Status Attack, performed as a Standard Action.
If it hits, the target falls Asleep. Dream Mist is collected
from Pok�mon with the eponymous Capability using a
Collection Jar but is also in rare occult shops for $500.
Magic Flute: Magic Flutes are rare artifacts made only
by skilled crafters with occult knowledge. They are not
usually found in stores. When a Flute is crafted, it is
tied to a particular Status Condition. Once per day, the
Flute may be played as a Standard Action. All Pok�mon
and Trainers within 20 meters of the Flute are cured of
that Status. These rare artifacts cannot be found in most
ordinary stores but may cost upwards of $4000 from an
appropriate occult vendor.
Cleanse Tags: Cleanse Tags are small strips of paper
with a prayer or incantation written on them. When
created, the creator makes an Occult Education Roll;
this is the Cleanse Tag's Power Value.
When glued, taped, or nailed to a surface, they stop
Pok�mon or Trainers within 30 meters of the tag from
Phasing through that surface, as if it was solid, unless
they make a Focus Skill Check with a result greater than
the Tag's Power Value. On a success, the tag is destroyed;
on failure, the tag holds, and the encroacher cannot try
again for at least an hour.
They may also be stuck onto a weapon or appendage to
let a Normal or Fighting-Type Attack hit a Ghost-Type
Pok�mon for Regularly-Effective Damage; once damage
has been dealt, the Cleanse Tag is destroyed.
Those with an Occult Education of Novice or higher can
also burn a Cleanse Tag as a Standard Action to remove
the Cursed, Suppressed, or Disabled condition from a
single target within 5 meters.
Those with an Occult Education of Expert or higher can
burn a Cleanse Tags to cause all Pok�mon and Trainers
within 30 meters with the Invisibility and Phasing
Capabilities to make a Focus Check; those whose
result does not exceed the Tag's Power Value lose both
capabilities for 5 minutes.
Cleanse Tags are simply made of paper and prayer and
cannot normally be purchased. However, select occult
shops may carry them for $500 or more depending on
the rarity of occult knowledge in the setting.
Tip: Don't make your players have to purchase paper to
make these ... but also, if your Trainer for some reason
can't access his belongings at all, they may not be able to
create Cleanse Tags unless they can find a scrap of paper
and a writing utensil.
Pester Balls: Pester Balls are small balls full of chemicals
that come in six varieties, each of which inflicts a
different Status Affliction when they hit a target. The
Status Afflictions they can cause are: Rage, Confusion,
Burn, Poison, Paralysis, and Sleep.
After being hit by any Pester Ball, a target becomes
immune to the effects of further Pester Balls for 1 hour.
Throwing and hitting with Pester Balls is the same as
with Pok� Balls.
Pester Balls cost $350.
Smoke Ball: When used, a Smoke Ball creates a 3
meter blast that fills the area with smoke, as if the move
Smokescreen had been used. Smoke Balls can only be
found in specialty shops for around $500.
