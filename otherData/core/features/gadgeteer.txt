Additional Changes
Mechanical Scrap is a new Scrap category that encom-
passes Items made with the Gadgeteer, Engineer, and
Upgrader Fields of Study.
Glue Cannons and Weighted Nets are replaced with
Cap Cannons, which have the following rules text:
Cap Cannon - Capsule Cannons - or Cap Cannons for
short - are two-handed pieces of Equipment which can
be loaded with different types of Capsules (Caps) and
fired. They can be fired as a Standard Action, and the
range and effect of the Cannon depends on the Cap
used. A Cap Cannon may have up to five Caps loaded
in it at once, and they do not have to be fired in any
particular order. You may load up to two Caps into a
Cannon as a Standard Action. There are three types of
Caps: Bean Caps, Glue Caps, and Net Caps. In addi-
tion to Caps, Capsule Cannons can also be loaded with
Smoke Bombs, Pester Balls, and Poke Balls. When fired
this way, these items behave normally but have a Range
of 10 meters. Capsule Cannons cost $5000.
Bean Cap - Bean Caps shoot as a small cloth projectile
filled with beads, which explodes upon contact, dealing
some damage.
Cost per Cap: $50
AC: ( 6 minus Tech Edu Rank, Minimum 2 )
Range: 10 meters
Effect: The target takes 20 Physical, Normal-Type Dam-
age. On 18+, the target is Tripped and loses a Tick of Hit
Points.
Glue Cap - Glue Caps shoot as a sticky orb that explodes
upon contact, covering the target in a sticky adhesive.
Cost per Cap: $100
AC: ( 8 minus Tech Edu Rank, Minimum 2 )
Range: 8 meters
Effect: Cause the target to become Slowed, and their
Initiative is lowered by 5. On 18+, the target is also
Stuck and Trapped.
Net Cap - Net Caps expand into a strong fibrous net
that cling to and entangle their target.
Cost per Cap: $200
AC: ( 10 minus Tech Edu Rank )
Range: 6 Meters
Effect: Targets hit by a Net Cap gain all the effects below
while the net remains on them. Targets may attempt to
remove the Net as a Standard Action; if they do, they
make a Save Check with a DC of 15, adding their Power
Capability as a bonus to their Roll. Targets may auto-
matically remove the Net as an Extended Action.
�

creased by +20
�
� If the target is Large Size or smaller, they take a -3
penalty to Accuracy Rolls

Slowed and Vulnerable

Prerequisite: Breadth of Knowledge, Master General
Education
Daily x2 � Free Action
Trigger: You or your Pok�mon make a roll

Book Item Mechanics
Books hold knowledge, and knowledge is power! Books are Items associated with Education Skills that can be used
during Extended Actions to Drain your AP to receive certain benefits.
After half an hour of study, you can Drain 1 AP to gain the benefits of one Rank of a Book , if you meet the prereq-
uisite Skill for that Book's Rank. Ranks in an individual book must be gained sequentially (e.g. you must have the
Novice Rank effect to gain the the Expert Rank effect).
The benefits from a Book last until an Extended Rest is taken; when an Extended Rest is taken, you may choose to
renew any Drain previously held from Books and continue to gain the effects.
Books generally cost $1000, but we are still looking at how to best price them. Give us feedback!
