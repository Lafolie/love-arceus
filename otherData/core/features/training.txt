Pokémon Training and Order Features
These Features are also used in the raising and battling of Pokémon but have special rules associated with them ­
all of them have the [Orders] tag or are Features that manipulate other Features with this tag.
Commander's Voice
Prerequisites: Two Features with the [Orders] tag
Static
Effect: You may give two different [Orders] as a single
Standard Action, or you may give one set of [Orders] as
a Swift Action.
Special: If this is used to use Focused Command and
another [Order] that has targets, the second Order
applies to both Pokémon you are commanding that
turn. Commander's Voice doesn't allow you to use
Focused Command as a Swift Action.
Focused Command
[Orders]
Prerequisites: Master Command, one of Focus, Guile,
Intimidate, or Pokémon Education at Expert
At-Will ­ Standard Action + Swift Action
Effect: You may have a second Pokémon take a turn this
round, but both Pokémon can only take At-Will actions
that round. Additionally, both Pokémon receive a -5
Penalty on all Damage Rolls. You may pay 1 AP at the
beginning of the round to lift the Frequency Restriction
OR the Damage Penalty for the remainder of the round,
or pay 2 AP to lift both.
Note: Focused Command has no targets, which may be
relevant to certain Features which refer to [Orders]
Training Features: The following four Features are special types of Orders which can also be used to train your
Pokémon outside of battle. They have special rules noted on the Feature Tags page that will be repeated here.
You may choose to use Training Features as either a [Training] or an [Orders] Feature; it never has both tags at
once when used.
You may use it as a [Training] Feature as an Extended Action after you spend at least an hour training your
Pokémon. If you do, the effect applies to any of the Pokémon Trained, and lasts until the end of your next Extended
Rest. A Pokémon can be under the effect of only one Training Regime at a time this way.
However, these Features may also be used as [Orders] as a Standard Action. When used as [Orders], this applies
only to one of your Pokémon, and lasts only until the beginning of your next turn. When used as [Orders], they
may stack with the effects of any active [Training] (whether the [Orders] be for Training of the same Feature, or a
different Feature).

[Stratagem] Features are special Orders which are activated once and then have a persistent effect while AP is
Bound. [Stratagem] Features may only be Bound during combat and automatically Unbind when combat ends.
Only one [Stratagem] may be Bound by a Pokémon at a given time.
When using a [Stratagem] on multiple targets, each AP Bind is paid separately and may be released separately as
well.

damaging melee attack, they become Vulnerable for one
full round.

range doubled until the end of their next turn, and deal
X additional damage. X is equal to the distance in meters
that the attack traveled. Long Shot does not increase the
size of area of effect attacks. If attacks altered by Long
Shot are Critical Hits, add the value of the Damage Dice
Roll an additional time to the total damage.
Orders, Training Features, and Trainer Classes
A number of Trainer Classes have their own Orders, or Features which are reliant on Orders and Training Features
to function. Because the effectiveness of using some of these Classes is often reliant on choosing other Order-
related Features for them to use, we're putting a list of all such Classes and their Features which are either Orders
or somehow synergize with Orders and Training Features in one place for you to easily browse.
Ace Trainer: Elite Trainer, Critical Moment
Channeler: Battle Synchronization, Spirit Boost
Cheerleader: Cheerleader; Moment of Action; Go,
Fight, Win!
Commander: The entire Class
