Mentor
Not all Pokémon are created equal. Some are naturally better off due to Species, pedigree, or even just their
Type or disposition. On the flip side, many of those on the stronger end of the spectrum are aware of it and
might have attitude issues with most Trainers. How do people get around these issues?
Some people just show a natural gift for dealing with these troublesome ones. They have the nurturing
touch to bring out the best in a Sewaddle and show a Charizard how its arrogance holds it back. These
Mentors don't really seek out problem cases, but when confronted with them have the knowledge and skills
to handle them appropriately. Their guidance is not lost on Pokémon in the middle of this spectrum either,
as they can help unlock anyone's true potential.
Mentor is a highly flexible Support Class for dealing with Pokémon with odd Abilities, Natures, and Move
Lists. They allow Pokémon to learn moves earlier than they normally would, learn more Moves, and
change a Pokémon's very nature. Most noticeable, however, is they can become Move Tutors with time and
practice.
