General Features
These Features are available to all Trainers as long they meet the prerequisites and are not contained as part of a
Trainer Class. They are separated into several categories, just like Edges are.
Command Versatility
Prerequisites: Adept Command, Guile, or Pokémon
Education
1 AP ­ Free Action
Trigger: Your Pokémon takes its turn.
Effect: Your Pokémon may give up use of a Scene or
Daily Move to regain use of a Scene or Daily Move
which it has already used. Your Pokémon may give up
use of a Daily Move to regain use of a Scene Move, but
not vice-versa. You may use Command Versatility only
once per Scene per Pokémon.
Press
Prerequisites: Adept Intimidate
At-Will ­ Standard Action
Target: Your own Pokémon.
Effect: You hit your Pokémon, and they lose 1/6th of
their Max Hit Points and are cured of Sleep. Raise any
two of their Stats by +1 CS each, and you may add half
of your Intimidate Rank to any Skill Checks made this
round to make this Pokémon obey orders. Using Press
on a Pokémon may make them dislike you.
Quick Switch
Prerequisites: Novice Acrobatics or Novice Guile
2 AP ­ Free Action
Trigger: Your Pokémon Faints; or an opponent sends
out a Pokémon
Effect: You may return and send out a Pokémon as a
Free Action. You may perform this Feature on your turn
without a Trigger. Pokémon sent out by Quick Switch
cannot trigger another trainer's Quick Switch. When
you swap Pokémon using Quick Switch, you do not lose
a Pokémon turn.
Species Savant
Prerequisites: 3 different individual Pokémon of the
same evolutionary line.
Static
Effect: When you take Species Savant, choose a single
Evolutionary Family. Your Pokémon of your Chosen
Evolutionary Family have each of their Base Stats
increased by +1.
Tutoring
Prerequisites: Novice General Education, Special (See
Effect)
One Time Use x 3 ­ Extended Action
Effect: When activating this Feature, select a Move
known either by yourself or by 3 Pokémon you own.
This Move is Mastered. As an Extended Action, you
may have Pokémon spend 2 Tutor Points to learn a
Move you have Mastered. Pokémon targeted this way
can only learn Moves that they could learn by Level Up,
TM, Egg Move, or Move Tutor. You may take Tutoring
multiple times, each time gaining 3 uses of the Feature.
Note: To be clear, this Feature lets you choose a total of
three different Moves you can Tutor. The use limitation
isn't on how often you can Tutor them; once you have
Mastered a Move, you can Tutor it At-Will.
