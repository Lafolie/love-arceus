Legendary Gifts
No matter the intent or process involved, when a
human is blessed by a Legendary Pokémon with some
of its powers, use the following Legendary Gifts. These
are sorted specific to species or sets of species, whereas
there also exist more general Gifts that will be sorted by
domain instead of species (see below).
Minor Gifts are always Edges and represent the first step
toward taking in a Legendary's power. They are usually
non-obvious effects or at least not overtly supernatural.
It is uncommon, although possible, for Trainers to
attain multiple Minor Gifts, particularly if they are from
within the same set of Legendaries.
Major Gifts are Features that represent a strong alliance
or blessing from a Legendary and are significant
instances of granted supernatural power. They should
not be attained easily, and accruing multiple Major
Gifts should be very difficult. It is very rare for Trainers
to attain Major Gifts from a second patron, and more
than that is the stuff of legend.
Pact Gifts are Features that represent either a nearly
unbreakable bond between Trainer and Legendary,
or a truly divine gift. They are usually the Legendary's
Signature Move and are incredibly powerful and
difficult to attain. They universally require a Trainer to
attain all of the Legendary's Major Gifts. It is impossible
for a Trainer to gain more than one Pact Gift. Lower
Pantheon Legendaries do not have Pact Gifts.
These aren't particularly balanced between options for
various species and the like. These are somewhat in your
hands as a GM to sort out what would be too powerful
for their campaign and what would be sensible.

The Outsider Gifts
Mewtwo, Genesect, Deoxys
...don't grant gifts. They're aliens and science
experiments that are extremely powerful, but they are
not part of the Pantheon, nor do they have any other
way of granting divine gifts.
That said, while Mewtwo does not grant divine gifts, a
Mewtwo's symbiant does have access to the following
gifts via Touched Edges and Features.
Minor Gift ­ Twin Souls
Prerequisites: GM Permission
Static
Effect: You and the Mewtwo you are bound to may
communicate telepathically, no matter the distance
between you. You are also gifted the Soulbound Edge.
Major Gift ­ Expanded Horizons
Prerequisites: Minor Gift ­ Twin Souls
Static
Effect: You gain either the Telepath or Telekinetic
Capability. If you possess both of these from their
respected Trainer Classes, you instead gain the
Godslayer Feature.
Major Gift ­ Mental Suggestion
Prerequisites: Major Gift ­ Expanded Horizons
Daily ­ Extended Action
Effect: Mental Suggestion requires both you and the
Mewtwo you are bound to be in the same vicinity.
Make a Focus check as if you were using Telepath.
On a success, you instill a thought or action into the
Target's mind as if it were one of their own. They may
not immediately act on it, and will question it if it is
too alien from how they would normally act, but the
thought will persist as long as they are unaware of its
origin.
Pact Gift ­ Psystrike
Prerequisites: Twin Souls, Expanded Horizons, Mental
Suggestion
Static
Effect: You learn the Move Psystrike.
MissingNo
MissingNo is a unique case in that there are multiple
interpretations offered in this book, and one set of
Gifts would not be able to cover all of them. Some
interpretations may not offer any Gifts at all, much like
the other Outsiders don't. For example, if MissingNo
were simply a literal glitch in the system of reality and
not even a sentient being, one could hardly expect to
receive a blessing from it. Some interpretations, such as
the fallen creator or the network god, would, however,
and so what will be offered here is a mixture of Gift
ideas fitting various interpretations of MissingNo that
can be used as a springboard for your own creations.

Fallen Creator
Minor Gift - Detect Heretic
Prerequisites: GM Permission
Static
Effect: You intuitively sense the presence of those with
non-MissingNo Gifts around you, though you have
no way of telling who they might be. The more Gifts

away from you.

lose 1/16th of their maximum Hit Points.
