Necrozma's Movement and Jumping capabilities become the bonded Pokémon's, as does Power if the bond's is higher. Necrozma's Athletics, Acrobatics, Combat, Stealth, and Perception become the bonded Pokémon's, though they are increased by one rank, to a maximum of 6d6. Necrozma takes the bond's Primary Type (or Secondary Type if its Primary Type is Psychic) as its Secondary Type.\n While bonded, the GM will designate one move as the bonded species' Level-Up Movelist as its 'signature move'. Necrozma may add this move to its learned movelist as long as it is bonded, following normal movelist restrictions, as long as it is of a level to learn it normally.\n For Solgaleo, this move is always Sunsteel Strike; for Lunala, this move is always Moongeist Beam. These Pokémon have specific forms used while bonded."

These may be disassembled into the number of Cells that they were created from as an Extended Action. 100 Cells may form either a 10% or 50% Zygarde with the Power Construct Ability instead of Aura Break. The resulting Zygarde may not be disassembled, but may be changed between 10% and 50% Formes as an Extended Action using the Cube. The GM determines the Nature and Level of any Zygarde formed.
