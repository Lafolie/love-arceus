Rotoms in their Appliance Forms retain most of the
same Basic Information as their Normal Form.
However, their Types, Size Information, Capabili-
ties, Skill List, and even Move List will change upon
changing forms. We've provided the standard set of
Appliance Forms here and what changes to apply
for them, but GMs should feel free to make up new
forms of their own.
